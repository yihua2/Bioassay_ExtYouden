Description: Implement the method of Extended Youden Design for bioassay experiments, which involves: 
    * generating an Extended Youden Design for a given balanced incomplete block design (BIBD),
    * checking the existence of Set of Distinct Representative (SDR) of a matrix,
    * searching for SDR of a matrix, and
    * calculating the information matrix and design efficiency of an Extended Youden Design.
